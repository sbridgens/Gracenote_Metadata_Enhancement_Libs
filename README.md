# Gracenote_Metadata_Enhancement_Libs
Libs for creating a Gracenote Metadata enrichment service


Created in order to build out a software service project that allows for gracenote data to be retrieved and updated based on a number of selection criteria

The workflow logic is not included here but the libs to carry out the same operations based on a workflow logic shown here: https://schtech.co.uk/end-to-end-gracenote-metadata-enrichment/ can be implemented using the libraries
